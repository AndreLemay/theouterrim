# The Outer Rim

The Outer Rim is a fan-made site for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars role-playing game. Find it at https://theouterrim.co.

## Contributing

Please don't hesitate to contribute! The project could use developers, but also audits and creation of new stats. Any and all help is equally appreciated!

### Running the project

- Have Node.js >=10
- Install project dependencies

```
yarn install
```

- Run the application

```
yarn start
```

- It will be available at http://localhost:8000.

### Contributing stats

#### YAML

All of the stats are kept in the `data` directory in one file each per stat type. In order to add a new entry, follow the format in the YAML file.

#### I don't want to do that

If you are interested in adding new or auditing existing stats, but don't aren't a developer or just don't want to deal with YAML, leave a comment in [the stats thread](https://github.com/duffn/theouterrim/issues/1) and let's talk! Leaving a comment may also be annoying as you'd need to create an account, so you can also find me on Reddit, the SWRPG Discord or Twitter under the same username.
